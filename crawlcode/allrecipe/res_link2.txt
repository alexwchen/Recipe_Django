                    For Cupcakes:
                    1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix with pudding
                    1/3 cup vegetable oil
                    3 egg whites
                    1 1/4 cups water
                    6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine
                    &nbsp;
                    For Filling:
                    1 cup cold heavy whipping cream
                    2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
                    1/2 cup frozen unsweetened raspberries
                    1/4 cup chocolate-coated toffee bits
                    1/2 cup finely chopped toasted hazelnuts, skins removed
                    &nbsp;
                    For Ganache:
                    1/2 cup heavy cream
                    6 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
                    &nbsp;
                    For Frosting:
                    1 (12 ounce) package white chocolate chips
                    1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
                    2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
                    2 teaspoons vanilla extract
                    food coloring, if desired (optional)
</ingredient>
<directions>
                    Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffin tins with 24 cupcake liners.
                    Combine the cake mix, oil, egg whites, and water in a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase the speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Stir in the chopped bittersweet chocolate and scoop the batter into the cupcake liners, filling them two-thirds full.
                    Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 20 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake should come out clean. Remove the cupcakes from the pans and cool completely on wire racks.
                    Beat 1 cup cold whipping cream on medium-high speed until the cream has thickened, about 1 minute. Add confectioners' sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. Stir in the frozen raspberries, toffee bits, and chopped toasted hazelnuts.
                    Remove the centers of the cupcakes using an apple corer or paring knife, cutting out the middles in a funnel shape by holding the knife at a 45-degree angle. Spoon or pipe the filling into the cupcakes. Refrigerate the cupcakes while you prepare the ganache.
                    Place the semisweet chocolate pieces in a heat-safe bowl. Bring 1/2 cup heavy cream to a boil. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate; cover the bowl and set aside for 5 minutes. Whisk the chocolate and cream until well combined; allow the ganache to cool until it reaches a spreadable consistency, about 1 hour. Spread a spoonful of ganache evenly over each cupcake. Refrigerate the cupcakes while you prepare the frosting.
                    Melt the white chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl by heating for 1 minute, stirring after 30 seconds. Allow the white chocolate to cool until almost room temperature but still fluid. Cream the butter and cream cheese together. Blend in the melted white chocolate, vanilla extract, and food coloring (if using). Spread the frosting on the cupcakes. Serve immediately, or refrigerate until serving.

                    1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin
                    1/2 cup apple butter
                    1 cup chopped walnuts
</ingredient>
<directions>
                    Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
                    Stir the flour, oats, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, ginger, and salt in a bowl.
                    Beat the butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add 1 egg and allow it to blend into the mixture before adding the other along with the vanilla. Add the pumpkin and apple butter; continue beating. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the walnuts, mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
                    Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, about 12 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

<ingredient>
                    1 3/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
                    1/4 cup honey
                    2 teaspoons instant yeast
                    6 cups stone ground whole wheat flour
                    6 tablespoons vital wheat gluten
                    1 tablespoon flax seeds
                    1 tablespoon flax seed meal
                    1 tablespoon rolled oats
                    1 tablespoon sesame seeds
                    1 tablespoon quinoa
                    1 tablespoon sunflower seeds
                    1 teaspoon salt
                    2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
</ingredient>
<directions>
                    Pour warm water and honey into a large bowl, and stir to dissolve the honey. Sprinkle the yeast over the top of the liquid, and let stand until the yeast bubbles and forms a creamy layer, about 10 minutes.
                    In a bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, gluten, flax seeds, flax meal, rolled oats, sesame seeds, quinoa, sunflower seeds, and salt until the seeds are dispersed evenly. Pour the flour mixture into the yeast mixture, add the coconut oil, and mix everything together. Scoop the dough out onto a well-floured surface, and knead until smooth and springy, about 15 minutes. Allow dough to rest for 15 minutes, then knead for another 10 minutes.
                    Form the dough into a ball, place in an oiled bowl, and turn the dough over several times to coat with oil. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 30 to 45 minutes.
                    Grease 2 9x5-inch loaf pans. Punch down the dough, and cut into 2 pieces. Form each piece into a loaf, place into the loaf pans, seam sides down, and cover the pans with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
                    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake the loaves in the preheated oven until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool in pans about 10 minutes before turning out to finish cooling on racks.

                    1 seedless watermelon
                    2 cups strawberries, hulled and sliced
                    1 cantaloupe - seeded, peeled, and sliced (optional)
                    1 fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and sliced (optional)
</ingredient>
<directions>
                    To create the base tier of the cake, cut 3 slices of watermelon, 1 to 2 inches thick, crossways through the center of the melon. Trim the rind from the watermelon slices, and place the largest slice onto a cake plate. Alternate layering sliced strawberries, slices of cantaloupe, and slices of fresh pineapple; follow with the second-largest watermelon slice. Repeat once more to make a layered fruit stack that looks like a cake.
                    Thinly slice a few pieces of remaining melon and pineapple. With cookie cutters or a sharp knife, cut remaining fruit slices into decorative shapes. Decorate the cake tiers with the cut fruit shapes and remaining berries.
                    Refrigerate until serving time. To serve, slice the cake with a sharp knife, one wedge at a time, and set the wedge onto a plate.
